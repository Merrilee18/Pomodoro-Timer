# Pomodoro-Timer

This is a classic pomodoro timer. The timer allows you alternate between "focusing" and "break" to help increase productivity. The timer chimes when it's time to take a break and then again when it's time to begin working. You can select the time duration for the focus and break sessions.

## Pomodoro Timer Focusing
Set the time that you want to focus and the time you want to take a bread, press "play" and then start working!
